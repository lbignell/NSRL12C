- Copied contents from NSRL13C.
- The intent of this simulation is to replicate the experiment carried out in
  2012 with the reflective and unreflective tubs.

Things to change:

Geometry: Hodoscopes, detectors, detector wall properties of reflective tub.
  	  I can use technical drawings but I may still need to rely on David.
Physics: Should not change.
Sensitive Detectors: I'll need to make 2 LS volumes sensitive, and assign the
	  	     PMTup and PMT down SDs to the new PMTs.
Run Action: Probably needs changing to reflect new SDs, etc.
Primary Generator: Need to reproduce the beam, and have a user-settable variable
		   that modifies the height of the beam entry point.

- Created PGAMessenger class to handle adjusting the height of the mean beam
  position. Tested working.
- I'm on the plane at the moment, so I'll need to wait until I have internet to
  get the technical drawings and can implement the geometry changes.

- There are some notes pasted on the back of notebook, page 29. These spell out
  the distances between the hodoscopes/tubs. The notes also indicate that the
  beam hit the centre of the tubs.
- I should git this code to both keep track of changes and make it accessible 
  between my various machines...

- Status to date:
  - Completed the geometry section of DetectorConstruction.
  - Put code into a Git repository and pushed to GitHub.

- Testing teflon tub optical properties. The optical photons need to traverse
  the white teflon if Cerenkov light is to be produced in it. So the way that I
  set up the optical interface must change.
  --> In my previous code I just had a uniform reflectance from the box that was
      implemented in SensitiveDetector.
  --> I can still do this for the black teflon box.
  --> However for the white one I must use the Geant4 optical surface models.
      What seems to work is having a ground dielectric-dielectric interface on
      the liquid/teflon barrier, and a ground dielectric-metal interface on the
      teflon/air barrier. I can then adjust the reflectance by modifying the
      attenuation length in the PFTE.
