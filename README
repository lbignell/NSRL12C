This code implements a Geant4 simulation of the NSRL12C measurements.
The scintillator fraction (% water), light yield, and Birks constant can be set
in a script, and changes to the density, refractive index, etc. are handled
automatically by the code.
The beam height is also set in a script.
Unfortunately, the code bails out if you change the geometry more than once in a
single run. I have worked around this by using perl scripts to modify and call
run scripts for situations where I want to automate several geometry changes.
(See the build directory for examples).
